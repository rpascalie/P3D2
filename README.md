# Prototype P3D2
Hello!

This is a prototype puzzle game where you control the player in a 3D and a 2D environement at the same time.
The 2D impacts the 3D. It can be played [here](https://rpascalie.github.io/P3D2/).

Use WASD (or ZQSD depending on your keyboard) to move, Space to jump and the mouse to look around.
